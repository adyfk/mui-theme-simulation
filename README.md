## Motivations

The purpose of this project is to help expose the power of the Material-UI Theme styling solution, specifically relating to setting default `props` for components and default styles through `components`.

By customizing default props and styles of components at the theme level, developers can easily tweak the look and feel of the app, and cut out the need for specifying common styling patterns within component code.

Future work on this project should be done with the goal of adding example previews that help accomplish this, useful snippets that take advantage of the Material-UI theme capabilities, and providing the user with better knowledge of the theme utilities in general.

_Have feature ideas, useful snippets, or bugs? Fantastic! Any help is appreciated, open an issue or submit a pull request!_
